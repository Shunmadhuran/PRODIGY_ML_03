Cat vs. Dog Image Classifier with SVM

This repository provides a Python application that implements a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier to distinguish between cat and dog images. It includes a user-friendly GUI for uploading images and visualizing results.

Features:

Image Classification: Trains an SVM model to classify images as cats or dogs.
Image Preprocessing: Resizes and converts images to grayscale for consistent input.
Feature Extraction: Flattens image pixels to create features for the SVM model.
Model Training and Evaluation: Trains an SVM classifier and evaluates its performance using accuracy score, classification report, and confusion matrix.
Interactive GUI: Uploads images for prediction, displays results, and allows viewing model evaluation metrics.
